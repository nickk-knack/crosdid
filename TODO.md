2. Rich embeds everywhere
   1. `index.js`
      1. `messageReactionAdd` event
      2. `channelCreate` and `channelDelete` events
   2. existing command modules
3. Additional reaction procesing (role on react type of thing?)
4. `message.awaitReactions` for a quick poll thing?
5. any other bot settings you want to add commands for?
6. ctrl-f "todo" in `index.js` and existing command modules
7. Fix reddit module
8. Think about everything in the bot that is user controlled, check for exploits (`bot.js` might have one)
9. Reimplement logging with `winston`
    1. Use `chalk` for coloring output?
10. `common-tags` for better template literals in code?
    1. Could really clean some shit up
    2. Also, opportunity to just write some custom tags... for fun?
    3. [Tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates)
